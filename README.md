# Foundation.Api

## Description

This is .NET 5 template that is optimized as a base for [Wrapt](https://wrapt.dev) projects built using the [Craftsman CLI](https://github.com/pdevito3/craftsman), to create a foundation for a standard CRUD API using the .Net Template Engine to create new projects on demand using `dotnet new`.

For full details, please see the [Wrapt documentation](https://wrapt.dev).
