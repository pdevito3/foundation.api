# Foundation.Api

## Description

This repo was previously used as a template for [Wrapt](https://wrapt.dev) projects built using the [Craftsman CLI](https://github.com/pdevito3/craftsman), but has now been depreciated and archived. You can still reference the project if you'd like, but will likely get more value out of a project build with the [Craftsman CLI](https://github.com/pdevito3/craftsman) as is it more feature rich and is more organized for work versus templating.
